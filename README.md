xrandr-profiles
===============

Call xrandr with certain parameters according to the current monitor
setup. This script recognizes screens using their EDID. If screens match the
EDID given in the config file, xrandr is run with predetermined parameters.

This is handy when certain xrandr calls have to be made continously when ones monitor setup changes.




This script is not production ready.
